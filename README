Features
========

Kimmybot is a Kingdom of Loathing bot based on the kimmybot core. Its main features at this time are rolling dice,
handing out wangs and shooting arrows.

Kimmybot was written by KimmyJ (#1783943) and is running on kimmybot (#2848651). It is based on franz1 (#2272489)'s Aleabot (#2379422) https://github.com/aleabot/aleabot.

If you want to make your own bot I suggest cloning from the kimmybot repo. There are a few code changes which must be made due to significant game changes, which include:

DICE ROLLING FEATURES

I can roll multiple (separate) dice at once:
/msg kimmybot roll 1d10, 1d100, 1d1000 in games

I can do funky math with dice:
/msg kimmybot roll (1d3)^(1d3)^(1d3) in games
will give 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 16, 27, 81, 256, 512, 6561, 19683, 134217728 or 7625597484987.

LIMITS

You can only roll dice in public once per minute.

A person can only be wanged up to 3 times a day and arrowed once a day. Also, you can only use the wang function up to 10 times per day and the arrow function once a day.
